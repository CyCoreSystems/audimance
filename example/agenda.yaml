#Cues begin with whatever pre-show warning (note these will still have to be triggered in qlab) and roll into your show cues.
#Show cues should be cut to be NO LONGER than 5 mins per cue to assure not freezing anyone's phone browser.
#The more simultaneous tracks available, the shorter the duration between cues should be.  
#See README for showfile hookup. You should be sending the contents of data over the UDP port (usually 9001) from qLab.
