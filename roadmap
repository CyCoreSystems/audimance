#Roadmap: Audimance

###Summary

Audimance is a tool for the creation and deployment of user-directed artistic audio experiences.
Content may be designed for use in isolation, as accompaniment to other media, or in conjunction 
with live performance using QLab. 

###Mission

Audimance enables a user-centered, flexibly complex, audio environment ideal for nonvisual audiences
and can be used to provide either single-track or multi-track audio description. 

Audimance provides a flexible deployment platform which:
- permits artists and content creators to easily deploy single or multi-track content
- facilitates venues in providing consistently available accessibility without large dedicated hardware systems
- creates user-directed aesthetic experiences which prioritize user agency for style and complexity

Critically, Audimance is designed to facilitate the use of pre-recorded descriptive content for performing arts 
synchronized via QLab for accurate and finely timed delivery of accessible communal experience. 

##Goals

###Mobile-native 

Conversion from the alpha webapp to a native mobile deployment is necessary 
to facilitate ease of use for audiences, artists, and venues as well as  
to implement both necessary and nice-to-have UI features.  

*Actions* 
We are actively forming a team and soliciting support for this major milestone.  
If you are interested in participating, or if your company can support this effort, please reach out.

###Creator UI

Currently, content is manually adjusted, uploaded, and spatially placed by editing the text fille. 
This needs a GUI plus functionality for auto-adjusting audio files and spatializing the result for 
novice users.  

###Venue UI

Currently, show selection and content availability is managed by network access.  Venue operators or artists
need to be able to set up venues and events with geofencing and time bounds for IP protection.

###Visual clone

Based on research conducted by Kinetic Light, the design model pioneered with Audimance's alpha deployment 
has been determined to also be suitable for deploying accessible content for d/Deaf & Hard-of-Hearing 
audiences.  

*Actions* 
Back-end refactor for content type flexibility //COMPLETE
Determine architecture of single/dual deployments //IN-PROCESS
Design UI for visual content 

###Documentation 

Audimance needs user documentation for content creation, end-users, and venues.
