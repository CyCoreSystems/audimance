# Audimance

Audimance is a tool for the creation of an entirely new kind of non-visual
artistic experience.  Audimance enables a user-centered and choice-centered rich
auditory experience to be used in isolation or in conjunction with a live
performance.

## Technical

Audimance is built on the W3C [Web Audio API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/)
standard.  It offers 3-D spatialization of many sound sources, source-separated
external synchronization (such as for synchronizing certain audio sources to a
live performance), and virtual rooms which may be traversed and chosen by the
individual audience members.
